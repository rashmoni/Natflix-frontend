# Natflix

The frontend for project #5 in the TietoEvry Java Course.

# About

This is a dummy frontend meaning that it has hardcoded data. The students must replace the false api calls done using a method called `fakeFetch()` and replace it with the real native `fetch()` method in JavaScript.

- Every tv-series opens information about Seinfield.
- Every movie opens information about Public servant.
- Every documentary opens information about The Last Dance.

# Modal details
